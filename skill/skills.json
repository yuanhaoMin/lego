It first retrieves a list of orders using the `get_orders()` function. It then filters this list to only include orders that have \"\u8f74\u627f\" (bearing) in the product name. \n\nThe function initializes a variable `total_cost` to keep track of the cumulative cost. It iterates over each bearing order, updates the cost by adding 300 to the existing cost, and creates an `OrderUpdate` object with the new cost. It then calls the `update_order()` function to update the order with the new cost. \n\nFinally, the function calculates the cost of each bearing order by multiplying the new cost with the quantity, and adds it to the `total_cost` variable. It prints the total cost and returns it.\n}"}}
