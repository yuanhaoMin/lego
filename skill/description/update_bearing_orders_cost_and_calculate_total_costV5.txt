update_bearing_orders_cost_and_calculate_total_cost {
This function updates the cost of bearing orders by adding 300 to the existing cost, and then calculates the total cost of all the bearing orders. It first retrieves a list of orders using the `get_orders()` function. It then filters this list to only include orders that have "轴承" (bearing) in the product name. 

The function initializes a variable `total_cost` to keep track of the cumulative cost. It iterates over each bearing order, updates the cost by adding 300 to the existing cost, and creates an `OrderUpdate` object with the new cost. It then calls the `update_order()` function to update the order with the new cost. 

Finally, the function calculates the cost of each bearing order by multiplying the new cost with the quantity, and adds it to the `total_cost` variable. It prints the total cost and returns it.
