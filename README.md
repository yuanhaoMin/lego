Low-Code Agent
This demo, inspired by Voyager (https://voyager.minedojo.org/), shows the potential of a GPT-powered agent acting as a low-code platform. With minimal human input and a set of foundational functions, the agent can generate complex code based on prompt input.

There is 3 Agents to simulate the process:
- Code Agent: Responsible for generating complex workflows based on foundational functions and user input.
- Critic Agent: Evaluates the correctness of generated code by analyzing inputs and compiler errors.
- Skill Agent: Manages learned workflows using a vector database, supporting CRUD operations.
